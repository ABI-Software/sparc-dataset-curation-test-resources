  "description": "Distribution of ghrelin is mapped as a distribution field over the gastric fundus and corpus regions of the stomach scaffold. \n\nThe field is a color map scaled across all 4 cell densities (somatostatin, 5-HT, pancreastatin, ghrelin) recorded in this dataset, with a minimum cell density of 25 cell/mm<sup>2</sup> (white) to maximum cell density of 125 cell/mm<sup>2</sup> (red).\n\nThe data is derived from 4 adult human patients undergoing gastric sleeve surgery for obesity and characterized the hormone content of endocrine cells within the mucosal lining of the stomach.",
